# FORGOBIKE EXPLORATION

## by Fatimah Ajoke Abudu Olaleye


## Dataset

This data set includes information about individual rides made for February, 2019 in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area and New York city.These bike share systems, with hundreds of stations and thousands of bikes across both cities. Itâ€™s a fun, affordable and convenient way to get around. The datasets can be found [here](https://github.com/BetaNYC/Bike-Share-Data-Best-Practices/wiki/Bike-Share-Data-Systems)


## Summary of Findings

The analysis of February bike rides from the San Francisco bay area and New York city was obtained for analysis. cleanup operations were required to get the dataset ready for analysis. No tidiness issues were addressed during the course of analysis, and overall insight shows no significant relationship between age and duration. All categorical variables shows no relationships rather than more participation of male subscribers on Thursdays. It was also observed there are more subscriber to customers, of which are more males than females, with teens and young adults, of age 18 - 34 taking majority of the members in both city datasets. The duration and age variable took on a large range of values, highly skewed to the right with a long tail. As result, I looked at the data using a log transform. Under the transformation, the data looked unimodal, with duration peak between 500 and 1000, and age distribution between 25 to 50 for the overall datasets.entation or not.


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focused on telling a story behind higher ride duration, with a look at different categorical variables like user types, gender, days, and so on. Lastly, I did some comparison between the two cities, San Francisco and New York bike rides datasets.
